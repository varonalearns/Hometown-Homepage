## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned a little bit more about font picking, since that is a stretch goal for this project. That led me to learn a little bit about graphic design adn the importance of typography.

### Continued development

- It seems pertinent that learning a bit of graphic design is a good idea to continue to become a well-rounded web developer. That is something that I am going to develop going forward.

### Useful resources

- [Google Font Pairing guide](https://heyreliable.com/ultimate-google-font-pairings/) - This guide helped me understand the importance of pairing the right typography with one another.
